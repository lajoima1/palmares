ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 pounds beef chuck, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 2 1/2 pounds after trimming)
- Freshly ground salt and pepper
- 1 ½ cups beef broth (or beef bone broth)
- 1 cup dry red wine (or substitute with additional beef broth)
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- ½ tablespoon balsamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 6 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 large yellow onion, cut into chunks
- 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch diagonal slices
- 1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes, diced into ½-inch cubes
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour (or gluten-free all-purpose flour)
- 1 cup frozen peas

instructions:
1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season beef with salt and pepper, then brown in batches until seared. Transfer browned beef to a 6 or 8-quart slow cooker.
2. Add beef broth, red wine, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, dried thyme, salt, and pepper to the slow cooker. Stir to combine.
3. Stir in minced garlic, onion chunks, carrots, and diced potatoes.
4. Cover and cook on low for 7-8 hours or on high for 4-5 hours, until beef is tender.
5. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 cup of the stew broth from the slow cooker with the flour until smooth. Stir the mixture back into the slow cooker.
6. Add frozen peas, stir, and cook uncovered on high for an additional 10-15 minutes until the stew thickens.
7. Serve hot with toasted French bread, cornbread, crackers, or biscuits.

notes:
- For a non-alcoholic version, substitute the red wine with additional beef broth.
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days.
- To freeze, let the stew cool completely, transfer to a freezer-safe container, and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before reheating.
